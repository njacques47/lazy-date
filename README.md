# lazy-date

## User Story
As a USER, I want to be able to quickly pull up a date idea. When I use the website I want to be able to choose between either a night in or a night out. 

## Ideas for Further Development
- What happens if the date goes bad and they won't let go? Sometimes you have to send a message loud and clear. 
- ability to filter search based on family friendly rating
